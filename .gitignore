# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore temporary output for tests etc.
spec/examples.txt
coverage
profiles
tmp

# Ignore compiled native code.
lib/twisty_puzzles/native.so

# Note that for apps, this *should* be checked in. But for gems, it shouldn't.
# The reason is complicated, but basically Gems shouldn't depend on exact versions while apps should.
