# Twisty Puzzles
Gem for my cube_trainer rails app. Some things are better left in a separate gem with no rails, e.g. native extensions. The main purpose is to support my Rails app, but if it's useful for someone else, feel free to use it at your own risk.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'twisty_puzzles'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install twisty_puzzles

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies. Then, run `bundle exec rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bundle exec bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
